    "Coach has many predefined presets that follow the algorithms definitions in the published papers, and allows training some of the existing algorithms with essentially no coding at all. This presets can easily be run from the command line. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`coach -p CartPole_DQN`\n",

    "Alternatively, Coach can be used a library directly from python. As described above, Coach uses the presets mechanism to define the experiments. A preset is essentially a python module which instantiates a `GraphManager` object. The graph manager is a container that holds the agents and the environments, and has some additional parameters for running the experiment, such as visualization parameters. The graph manager acts as the scheduler which orchestrates the experiment.\n",
